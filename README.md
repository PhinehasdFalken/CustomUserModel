Ok, It's nice to meet you. I'm Phinehas.

I'm writing this in hope that you have a little to no knowledge in the Django project and a very healthy does of understanding in the Python Lang. 
So without any further ado, let'd dive in. Now i just realised that by saying that, I just further adoed. And now again ðŸ˜‚ 

So let's dive in, shall we?
You should have created your django project and probably stuck trying to create your custom user model for your project. You're on the right repository.

To Start:
You want to create a user app in your project directory with the command- py manage.py startapp 'youruserappname'

Once that app is created, you should have some of the same files I have in my users folder in this repository.

Now you want django to be able to access that newly created user app you have, so now you navigate to your main project folder and to the settings.py
look for the list of INSTALLED_APPS amongst the already written code there.
Add 'youruserappname' to the list and don't forget to add a ',' after that.

Now back to your user app.

#### NOW MY CODE

To be continued...
